Embedded Assembly

Extended assembler
__asm__ [volatile] [goto] (AssemblerTemplate
                           [ : OutputOperands ]
                           [ : InputOperands  ]
                           [ : Clobbers       ]
                           [ : GotoLabels     ]);

the first optional qualifier is volatile. This specifier just tell the compiler
to stop (optimization)

the second optional qualifier is goto. The qualifier tells the compiler that
the given assembly statement may perform a jump to one of the labels which are
listed in GotoLabels.

How to read assembly instructions:
* names of processor registers must be prefixed with %%

Clobbers is a list of registers or other values which are modified by the
assembler instructions from the AssemblerTemplate beyond those listed in the
OutputOperands.
